# Overview

The first programming language I learned is C++, so when I heard that there is
a language similar to C++, but without the headache of memory management, I knew I
had to give it a try! Rust seemed like a highly powerful, efficient language that
would be a valuable asset in every programmer's toolbox. Even though my program 
barely scratches surface of what Rust can do, I can tell that my initial assumption
was correct. This is a language that I hope to learn in depth and utilize regularly.

My program is designed as a password manager to be displayed through the command terminal.
It can store the name of an account, the account username, and the account password for
a user. When entering a new account, the user may choose to enter their own password or
a password automatically generated by the program. The way the password is generated is very
low-level at the moment, but I've already included a PasswordSpec struct that will eventually
be used to provide more controlled password-generated specifications that the user can control.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was developed in Rust, and its database
was created using SQLite3 wrapped in the Rustqlite library.

Rust: version 1.74.1
Rusqlite: version 0.30.0
rand: version 0.8.5

# Future Work

- Functionality for editing account entries.
- Functionality for deleting account entries.
- Allow user to provide randomly-generated password specifications.
- Adapting program to use a GUI instead of command line interface.
- Incorporate password encryption for storing passwords.
